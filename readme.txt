Notes on editing:

    This website was rebuilt because it had become too cumbersome to
maintain and modify effectively. In particular, the HTML code that comprised
the site had become more or less indecipherable because the site was built
using a program that is no longer maintained and which produced badly
structured and hard to read HTML code.

    In order to keep from having to rebuild the website every few years, I
recommend NOT using a website building application, but rather editing the
HTML and CSS files directly in a text editor (e.g notepad, TextEdit, vim,
nano, emacs, etc.) You can view your changes directly in your web browser. In
additon, below are some reccomendations about how to edit the site without
breaking things now or in the future.

    1.  Learn some HTML, so you can understand the code. If you know what
    the code does it will be easy to edit the website so that it works.
    There is a good tutorial on HTML and CSS at www.htmldog.com (as of
    2015). If you know the basics of programming (in any language) the
    tutorial should only take a few hours to teach you what you need to
    know. If even if you dont know any programming, it should still be
    pretty quick.

    2.  Use good coding style. There's a lot of information on coding
    style on the internet, but there are two important parts (in my
    opinion). First, use comments to make notes for anyone who may have to 
    understand the code in the future. Second, use indentation. Indentation 
    makes it far easier to understand and edit the code in the future.

    3.  Comply to internet standards. In particular, wherever possible
    you should put website content (i.e. text, images, etc.) in the HTML
    file and presentation configuration (e.g. font size, background color,
    etc.) in the CSS file. This makes the code easier to understand and
    edit, and it makes it easier to make the website look consistent. Also,
    avoid doing anything fancy; different web browsers treat websites
    slightly differently, so trying to do anything complicated is likely to 
    cause problems that are hard to find and very hard to fix.

The rest of this file contains some notes about the structure and design of
the website. These notes aren't crucial, but they may be useful.
