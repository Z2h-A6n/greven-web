# greven-web
The future research group website for Martin Greven's group at the University of Minnesota.

## About
This GitHub repository is used for developing and maintaining our group website. As of this writing, it is a public repository which anyone can see, so keep that in mind when making changes and submitting feedback.

Currently, this repository contains a work-in-progress version of the future group website; you can see the current version [here](http://groups.physics.umn.edu/grevengroup/index.html "Current Greven Group Website").

## Viewing the site
There are several ways to view the website:
  * [View it on the web.](http://homepages.spa.umn.edu/~zanderso/greven-web/index.html "Home page via Zach's physics page.")
  * Download the contents of this repository and view the site on your local computer. Use the "Clone or Download" button in the upper right.


## Submitting feedback
If you have suggestions for improving the site or if you see any bugs, please submit an issue to the issue tracker by going to the "Issues" tab in GitHub. If you don't have a GitHub account, either sign up for a GitHub account (if you expect to submit lots of bugs and suggestions, or if you intend to help with the code), or send an email to someone who is working on the code.

## Editing the website
To edit the website, you should download the files onto your computer and make changes there. To do this, you should use a program called git. Note that this repo uses git-lfs, which is an extension to git that helps manage large files. This means that you need to also install git-lfs, otherwise you will not be able to download the large file (i.e. images). See [DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/Z2h-A6n/greven-web/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md "Development README") for details.

Some web browsers have pretty good support for editing pages as you view them, so that's also a quick and easy option for testing out small changes. See for example [Firefox's Page Inspector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector).

## Development
See [DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/Z2h-A6n/greven-web/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md "Development README") for resources and guidelines related to developing the website.
