# Website development
Some guidelines and resources for web development in general and this site in particular.

## Important notes
In order to keep things organized, always follow these rules unless it's impossible to do otherwise
### Web development
  * Use good coding style.
    * Use comments to make notes in the code
    * Use indentation to make the code structure clear
  * Follow HTML/CSS coventions
    * HTML should be used for all content, and content only.
    * CSS should be used for styling and presentation and only for styling and presentation.
    * HTML and CSS should be in separate files to the greatest practical extent.
  * Don't make things more complicated than the should be. Just because we can make a fancy website
  feature with JavaScript or PHP doesn't mean we should.

### Web design
  * I don't know anything about web design, but it's probably a good idea to look up some of the
  basics (and add some guidelines here).

### Git and GitHub use
  * Keep commits small. If you're planning to do a lot of unrelated things, consider making separate
  commits.
  * Use meaningful and short commit messages
  * If you are going to work on a feature or bugfix that will take a long time, consider forking the
  repo.

## Guidelines
Some guidelines. TODO: Write some guidelines.
